# AER202

AER202 is a tool that uses machine learning to automatically identify planes 
from a photo. The goal is to assist plane-spotters by identifying subtle 
airplane characteristics that might be otherwise difficult to spot by eye. 
Applying neural networks to this problem could greatly increase the 
identification accuracy and speed. 

Currently the tool is trained on:
